LaTeX paper template by Ben Mitchell (benjamin.r.mitchell@villanova.edu),
released under CC-BY license 

Last updated: 2018-03-22


Files:

  hw4template.tex - the LaTeX source for the template document 

  templateBibliography.bib - the BibTeX source containing the citation
      descriptions

  Makefile - a makefile that will automatically generate the document

  images/ - a directory for images that are used in the document

  output/ - the directory where built documents and output files are put


Instructions:
  To compile the template (on a Unix-style system), simply type `make` on the
  commandline from this directory.  The template will automatically be
  compiled, and the finished result will be put in the output/ directory.

  This procedure is controled by the Makefile, which is simply a way of
  automating the build process so you don't have to type the same commands by
  hand over and over again.  See the comments in the Makefile for more details
  on how it works, or look up the online documentation for GNU Make.

  Alternatively, you should be able to import these files into whatever GUI
  system you like; offline versions include things like TeXStudio, TeXWorks,
  TeXShop, etc. (just do a google search).  Online versions include things like
  overleaf.com, which is a cloud-based LaTeX environment with a web-based front
  end.
